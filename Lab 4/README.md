# Ph-UI!!!

For lab this week, we focus on both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 

## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:

**\[recommended\]**Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2021
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

### Start brasinstorming ideas by reading: 
* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 
* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 
* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/1200x900/4401-01.jpg" height="150">
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). In this lab, we will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created before. Activate `circuitpython` and `cd` to your Lab 4 folder to install the requirements by:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/679721816318803975/823299613812719666/PXL_20210321_205742253.jpg" width=400>
These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-03.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separated breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4991-09.jpg" height="200">
</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script, it comes with an additional button which might be useful for your design!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python encoder_test.py
```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

#### Joystick

A [joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) can be used to sense and report the input of the stick for it pivoting angle or direction. It also comes with a button input!

<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/3/5/5/8/15168-SparkFun_Qwiic_Joystick-01.jpg" height="200" />
</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script to see what it can do!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python joystick_test.py
```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick_Py) to learn more about the sensor!

#### (Optional) Distance Sensor

Note: We did not distribute this sensor to you, so if you are interested in playing with it, please come pick it up from the TA!

Earlier we have asked you to play with the proximity sensor, which is able to sense object within a short distance. Here, we offer [Qwiic Multi Distance Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17072), which has a field of view of about 25Â° and is able to detect objects up to 3 meters away!

```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_VL53L1X_Py) to learn more about the sensor and see other examples!

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

Some of the questions are written as notes in the design sketches above. I'll reiterate and add onto them here.

**Design 1: Picture Frame**
- Should the touch actions result in randomized results or it is a set of pre-loaded pictures, specifically for each sensor? This is just a thought question that I don't need a physical protoype to figure out.

**Design 2: Mini Piano**
- What keys can I fit into 12 sensors? Should I include flats/sharps or is playing two notes at once sufficient? From a physical point of view, would a physical display without the black keys (if I'm going for a true piano looking physical prototype), be as automatically recognizable? Likely not, but testing a physical wizard with people would answer this.
- Would a musical sheet style button design be convenient to use? This would be aimed at musicians who already know notes on a staff, but adding the names of the notes (A, B, C, D, etc.) should solve that issue. I would need to physically prototype this layout, to see if it feels comfortable to use.

**Design 3: Music Box**
- Is it better to use a design with integrated sensors into the design itself or have a central design surrounded by more obvious sensors? This is a purely design question on whether I want this to be a more incognito device or if I want it to obviously be interactive. I prefer something more incognito.
- As I drew the design, I also noticed it may be difficult to have the box open and be actually useful while hiding the Pi/wires. The box lid can be closed off, hiding wires and the Pi can also be hidden in the botton, but the connecting wires could be difficult with a hinge style box. I would need to text this physically. That, or I can avoid this issue by making it a drawer style box rather than having it open up on top.

**Design 4: Mirror Mirror on the Wall (Light sensor, not touch sensor)**
- The design wasn't thought of with a touch sensor in mind. However, I could add an LED strip around the mirror which will make it more like a makeup mirror. Then, this light can be activated via touch sensors around the frame. There would be an on-off sensor and two more for brightening and dimming.
- The light sensor can detect guestures, but only in close proximity, at a level which could feel awkward, but I can't be too sure until I prototype it to test. I wouldn't have to stand too closely to trigger it, but my hands would need to be close to the sensor, so the positioning on the frame would need some testing. I need to physically prototype with sensors in varying locations on the mirror frame to get an idea of where the most comfortable and intuitive locations to place them are.

**Design 5: Physical Chess Coach**
- This design uses a touch based grid, one that would use 64 sensors. While there are some interesting technical questions on how to implement the chess coach and how to detect piece movement without adding unnecessary sensor identifiers, there is very little to physically prototype, or are there questions answerable with physical prototyping, other than, how will we make the the sensors detect when a piece has been placed on them? Would the user need to tap the starting and ending squares? 
- The lack of questions mostly stem from the fact the design is just a classic chessboard.

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

I will be building the touch based music box.


### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts


Here is an Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibily be mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/679466987314741338/823354087105101854/PXL_20210322_003033073.jpg" height="200">
</p>


It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

<img width="833" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 1 40 01 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14368010/138640313-2bdaa39b-b0e5-4517-9e5e-d2516f7e09af.png">


**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

The first and possibly most worrying question is will the user know this is meant to be a music box. All of my display designs, except the first option, are focused on a minimalistic design that integrates the interactive elements into the artistic design of the music box lid. However, ultimately, I decided that I want the casual observer to not even know this is a music box, until they actually interact with it.

A major thing these design bring up is spacing. Some of the components this needs to succeed that I currently have take up quite a bit of space, i.e. the webcam speaker. Perhaps in the future I will order some parts and make this more streamlined for practical use/building a more permanent unit.


**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***

I will be using Option 3, the display that is a box which can open up to show the internal pi and mechanisms. This way, the music box can be incognito, but the user can still appreciate the inner workings, much like how most music boxes show you the drum that actually create the music.


**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

As explained above, I want this box to be a good displayable size, perhaps smaller than a 10in cube. Also, the display must be incognito. I want it to look like a normal pretty box, and blend in with normal decor. The user will know it's interactive after the first time they interact with it. This is a purely physical/sensory device, and has no digital displays (again hiding the fact there's anything electronic going on, unless you see the external power cord, though perhaps in the future I will build a version with a chargable power bank).

Something about having a thing be more then just pretty, but surprisingly so, is very appealing to me.

Build a cardbord prototype of your design.

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***

My rough prototype was literally the box our Pi kit came in. I put in in there with the webcam speaker, and had a bundle of wires coming out the box to use the capacity sensor.


LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

### Part E (Optional)
### Servo Control with Joystick

In the class kit, you should be able to find the [Qwiic Servo Controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16773) and [Micro Servo Motor SG51](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201). The Qwiic Servo Controller will need external power supply to drive, which we will be distributing the battery packs in the class. Connect the servo controller to the miniPiTFT through qwiic connector and connect the external battery to the 2-Pin JST port (ower port) on the servo controller. Connect your servo to channel 2 on the controller, make sure the brown is connected to GND and orange is connected to PWM.

<img src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/245605956_303690921194525_3309212261588023460_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=FvFLlClTKuUAX9nJ3LR&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&oh=b7ec1abc8d458b6c1b7a00a6f11398ac&oe=618D7D96" width="400"/>

In this exercise, we will be using the nice [ServoKit library](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/python-circuitpython) developed by Adafruit! We will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created. Activate the virtual environment and make sure to install the latest required libraries by running:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

A servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position. The position of a servo motor is set by the width of an electrical pulse, that is, we can use PWM (pulse-width modulation) to set and control the servo motor position. You can read [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn a bit more about how exactly a servo motor works.

Now that you have a basic idea of what a servo motor is, look into the script `qwiic_servo_example.py` we provide. In line 14, you should see that we have set up the min_pulse and max_pulse corresponding to the servo turning 0 - 180 degree. Try running the servo example code now and see what happens:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python servo_test.py
```

It is also possible to control the servo using the sensors mentioned in as in part A and part B, and/or from some of the buttons or parts included in your kit, the simplest way might be to chain Qwiic buttons to the other end of the Qwiic OLED. Like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="chaining.png"  width="200" ></p>

You can then call whichever control you like rather than setting a fixed value for the servo. For more information on controlling Qwiic devices, Sparkfun has several python examples, such as [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide/all#python-examples).

We encourage you to try using these controls, **while** paying particular attention to how the interaction changes depending on the position of the controls. For example, if you have your servo rotating a screen (or a piece of cardboard) from one position to another, what changes about the interaction if the control is on the same side of the screen, or the opposite side of the screen? Trying and retrying different configurations generally helps reveal what a design choice changes about the interaction -- _make sure to document what you tried_!

### Part F
### Record

Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the device

### Music Box Demo

### Reflecting on Feedback

Unfortunately, I didn't get any feedback from Canvas (the one comment said there wasn't anything on my github, which is possible, I submitted part 1 a little after the Monday deadline). However, I approached my friends about my design and got some actionable feedback. 

My initial design only had sensors for specific songs and a stop button. The stop button stops and cancels whatever song was playing previously. A friend noted that maybe they only want keep the music going without interacting every time. I implemented a loop mode for this, and it also inspired me to add a shuffle song button, for when you don't care about what song you want the box to play. This way, the music box can also be quite useful during study sessions.

While some were intrigued by the incognito design idea, a couple people disliked not being able to know what buttons did what. So, I did some sketching and decided that the inner lid showing the Pi/box internals has valuable retail space that is not being used. I decided the non-specific song sensors should be placed here. I made sure the sensors all had labels.

Based on the feedback on not having enough clarity with the buttons, I realized the box also lacked clarity about its current state. So, I added status updates to the Pi display. Given how I've added more functionality, not having direct feedback on current state would be too confusing. So, the display will show the current song, if the box is in select/shuffle or loop mode.

As I was iterating, I accidentally left out the reset button, and a friend testing my device reminded me to put it back in.

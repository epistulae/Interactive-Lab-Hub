# Zenith

Habit building is hard. It takes determination and perseverance, and having daily reminders help. Unfortunately, most habit tracking apps are cluttered or easily forgotten. 

Introducing Zenith, habit tracker where you light your way through the stars. This functional decor tracks up to two habits over 30 days, giving you a visual reminder to complete your goals. When inspiration strikes, don't wait til next Monday, next month, or even next year. Zenith doesn't label by the calendar so it's easy to start tracking your goals whenever. 

Zenith is also great for when it's time to relax. Just switch over to colored or animation mode for interesting mood lighting. 

Basic controls for habit tracking are on the frame, along with mode cycling and an on-off switch for the lights. The full suite of controls are available on the companion mobile app. Remember to log your activity every day either physcially or through the app! Once it's past midnight, you won't be able to give yourself credit. 

**Other functions:**
- (TODO) Do not disturb times: Set times when Zenith's lights should automatically turn off or on.
- Remote color and animation: Choose between a set of colors and animations.
- (TODO) Persistent mode: Save your habit tracking data and export to the app and see how you're doing over time.
- (TODO) Single vs duo habit mode: Only want to track one habit for longer? Switch to single habit mode to track one habit over 60 days instead of 2 habits over thirty. Note: Only available if you have not started tracking yet. If you've already begun, you'll have to start anew.

Coming soon: Zenith will be able to connect to your Spotify account and visualize the current track.
